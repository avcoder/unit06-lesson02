# Exercise: Create simple React component
25 mins

- Create a component called `<FollowPerson>`
- reminder: all React components have to start with a Capital Letter
- see https://tachyons.io/components/lists/follower-notifications/index.html

   <img src="/assets/inbox.png" />

- What props do you think we'll need for this component?
- What other potential components could be developed/imported inside `<FollowPerson>` component?

# Iteration
to make lists, simply use the vanilla JS array method .map.  

```jsx
const PeopleList = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>People to Follow</h2>
      { 
        people.map(person => (
          <FollowPerson
            key={ person.id } // notice we use key
            name={ person.name }
            username={ person.username }
            followHandler={() => console.log('clicked follow button')}
          />
        ))
      }
    </div>
  );
};
```

# Exercise: Lists 
10 mins

- create a list via `.map()` to make at least 3 `<FollowPerson>` components
- Make up your own array of people data
- Can copy/paste JSON data from https://randomuser.me/

# Conditionals

- in JSX, with the curly braces, we can't use JS statements, only expressions
  - why do you think we can't use JS statements?  (think what is being passed to `React.createElement()`? )
- use of `&&` 
  - ex: `{ isOnline && <div className="green" /> }`
  - why does the above work?  what's happening?
  - ex: `{ numOfItems > 0 && <ShoppingList items={shoppingList} /> }`
  - ex: `{ !!numOfItems && <ShoppingList items={shoppingList} /> }`
- use of ternary operators
  ```jsx
  return (
    <>
      { isLoggedIn ? <AdminDashboard /> : <p>Please login first</p> }
    </>
  )
  ```

# Exercise: Use conditional for a prop
5 mins. Continuing with your first iteration of this component from an earlier slide...

- Modify your `<Button />` component such that if it is given the `disabled` prop, it will actually make the button disabled
   - reminder: can disable an HTML button tag via `<button disabled>Submit</button>`
`<Button label="Submit" disabled />`

# Exercise: Use conditional for text
5 mins. Continuing with your first iteration of this component from an earlier slide...

<img src="/assets/inbox.png" style="width: 400px" />

- make it so that if variable `isFollowing` is true, then the button text will say `- Following`
   - otherwise if `isFollowing`is false, then button text will say `+ Follow`
