# Recap

- reminder: Algorithm and Data Structure Assignment due Jul. 20 
- repo of where we left off: https://github.com/avcoder/test-react
- [last time](https://unit06-lesson01.netlify.app/1) we just finished replacing the App.tsx `<button>` with our `<Button>` component

# Common Gotchas
Try the following common errors to see what errors look like in React.  Find solutions for each.

- Forgetting to `return` JSX
- Confusing camelCase for HTML attributes `onclick vs onClick`
- Using `class` instead of `className`
- if using inline styles, using hyphenated names instead of camelCase 
  - ex: `background-color vs backgroundColor`
- Multiple top-level elements without a wrapper/fragment
- DON'T use if statements directly inside JSX like `return ( if (isLoggedIn) { <p>Welcome</p> });`
- Not using `key` in lists
- JSX requires properly closed tags, even for void elements. ex: `<input /> <br />`
- what happens if props are undefined? ex: `return (<div className={someUndefinedClass}>Hi</div>)`
- if `numOfItems` is 0, this will render 0 `{numOfItems && <ShoppingList items={shoppingList} />}`
- examine if there are any more red squiggly lines in VSCode?

# Exercise: Use React DevTools to find component
- Install React DevTools for your browser and explore it (should be similar to Vue DevTools)
- Goto: instagram.com
   - Try to find the React component for the Login button
   - why do the React components look weird/minified? (prod vs development)
   - Try to change a value of a prop in any component to see what might happen
- View your local App.tsx again in the browser
  - Just like you right-click inspect DOM element to find that particular HTML element in the DOM, you can do similar with React components
  - try changing prop values (like `label`)
  - Tip: in Chrome devtools, can use `Cmd + p` to find React filename

# Exercise: Draw components
Use your Zoom pencil to draw all the potential components on the following.  fyi - this is from an actual interview take-home I did from my last company.  Tip: This could also help with your assignment.

# Exercise: Draw components (pg.2)
Use your Zoom pencil to draw all the potential components on the following images

- In breakout groups, take 10 minutes to draw potential components in the following designs

# Exercise: Create simple React component
25 mins

- Create a component called `<FollowPerson>`
- reminder: all React components have to start with a Capital Letter
- see https://tachyons.io/components/lists/follower-notifications/index.html

   <img src="/assets/inbox.png" />

- What props do you think we'll need for this component?
- What other potential components could be developed/imported inside `<FollowPerson>` component?

---
transition: slide-left
---

# Iteration
to make lists, simply use the vanilla JS array method .map.  

```jsx
const PeopleList = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>People to Follow</h2>
      { 
        people.map(person => (
          <FollowPerson
            key={ person.id } // notice we use key
            name={ person.name }
            username={ person.username }
            followHandler={() => console.log('clicked follow button')}
          />
        ))
      }
    </div>
  );
};
```

# Exercise: Lists 
10 mins

- create a list via `.map()` to make at least 3 `<FollowPerson>` components
- Make up your own array of people data

# Optional: Configure imports to use absolute path

- Use ChatGPT to help you configure your tsconfig.json, tsconfig.app.json, vite.config.ts
- ‚ùå Using relative paths can be a pain point, especially when refactoring locations of files/folders
- ‚úÖ should now be able to use `import Component from '@/components/whatever'

# Conditionals

- in JSX, with the curly braces, we can't use JS statements, only expressions
  - why do you think we can't use JS statements?  (think what is being passed to `React.createElement()`? )
- use of `&&` 
  - ex: `{ isOnline && <div className="green" /> }`
  - why does the above work?  what's happening?
  - ex: `{ numOfItems > 0 && <ShoppingList items={shoppingList} /> }`
  - ex: `{ !!numOfItems && <ShoppingList items={shoppingList} /> }`
- use of ternary operators
  ```jsx
  return (
    <>
      { isLoggedIn ? <AdminDashboard /> : <p>Please login first</p> }
    </>
  )
  ```

# Exercise: Use conditional for a prop

- Modify your `<Button />` component such that if it is given the `disabled` prop, it will actually make the button disabled
   - reminder: can disable an HTML button tag via `<button disabled>Submit</button>`
`<Button label="Submit" disabled />`

# Exercise: Use conditional for text

<img src="/assets/inbox.png" style="width: 400px" />

- make it so that if variable `isFollowing` is true, then the button text will say `- Following`
   - otherwise if `isFollowing`is false, then button text will say `+ Follow`
